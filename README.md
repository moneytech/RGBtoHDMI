# RGBtoHDMI

The RGBtoHDMI interface converts the "digital" RGB video signal from
the BBC Micro or Electron to HDMI compatible with most modern
TV/Monitors. The interface comprises a Raspberry Pi Zero and a
specially designed Hat containing a small CPLD. Custom firmware on the
Raspberry Pi, in conjunction with the CPLD, is able to correctly
sample each of the Beeb's video modes to give a pixel-perfect
rendition.
